<h1>Welcome to JoomlaPack</h1>
<div style="font-size: larger;">
<p>
	JoomlaPack is distributed under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_blank">
	GNU General Public License, version 2</a> or - at your option - any later version.
	As stated in the license, paragraphs 11 and 12, JoomlaPack comes with <em>no warranty,
	either expressed or implied</em>. Keeping this in mind, we'd like to tell you what you
	should do in order to protect your data and their integrity.
</p>
<p>
	The backup operation is harmless to your site. Backing up <b>does not</b> modify
	any of your site's files or database contents, except data written in special,
	JoomlaPack-only tables. Thus, backing up your site will cause no trouble. Should
	the backup process gets stuck, you should first read the thorough documentation
	available both <a href="http://www.joomlapack.net/documentation2x.html">on-line</a>
	and <a href="http://joomlacode.org/gf/projects/jpack/frs">as a PDF file</a> for
	off-line reading and/or printing. There is also integrated on-line help, available
	from the &quot;Help&quot; button on each page. Should this not be enough, we have
	a <a href="http://forum.joomlapack.net">support forum</a> where we can help you out.
</p>
<p>
	The <b>restoration process</b> is a different story. Restoring a site <em>overwrites</em>
	any existing files and / or database content. If you are not carefull, it will
	break your site! To this end <strong>we strongly advise you to practice backup
	restoration on a local testing server first</strong> - in order to get the hang
	of it - before attempting so on a live, working site. Having read the documentation
	first is imperative and it will save you much trouble and support requests.

	by pressing the button labelled &quot;I agree&quot;. Pressing the &quot;I do
	not agree&quot; button will get you back to the administrator's home page.
